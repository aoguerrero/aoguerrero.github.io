My name is Andrés, and I've been working as a Java developer for almost 20 years, I enjoy coding in other languages as well, and I live in Colombia.
  
I'm a passionate Linux and FLOSS user, my favorite Distribution is Fedora, and in my PC it can't be missing:
  
Inkscape, GIMP, Libre Office, VLC, ffmpeg, OBS, KDEnlive, Rclone, Eclipse, CudaText, Helix, Xournal++, Blender, QCAD, and many others.

Also, I enjoy playing Minetest with my two kids!

I love to spend time with my wife, and I have other interests, like  parenting, and ride my bicycle everywhere I need to go. I like to draw with the same enthusiasm as when I was a child, and I like to design and build papercrafts. 

I don't like cars a lot, but I know the basics about car repairing and have an old renault twingo.
